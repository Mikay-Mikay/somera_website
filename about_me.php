                <h1>About Me</h1>
                <h5>A 2nd-Year<span> BSIT Student</span></h5>
                <p>Welcome to my Website! Here, you can learn more about me, such as my interests, current passion, etc. My
                    name is Mikaela Somera, and I am a student who is just starting to develop a passion or interest in
                    UI/UX Design with a good basis. My journey in UI/UX design has been a dynamic exploration of
                    balancing creativity with user-centric functionality. A mission to make digital interactions into
                    fascinating adventures, with a background in other programming languages such as Java, Python, and
                    JavaScript. For markup languages, I use HTML and XML. In the year 2026, I will finally earn my
                    degree (Bachelor of Science in Information Technology with a focus on mobile and internet) from
                    National University Fairview. I delved into the principles of design, human-computer interaction,
                    and the psychology of user experience. This academic background laid the groundwork for my passion
                    for creating seamless and engaging digital interfaces. The combination of my educational background
                    and hands-on experience has equipped me with a holistic understanding of UI/UX design. It's not just
                    about creating visually appealing interfaces but about orchestrating experiences that leave a
                    lasting impact on users. My college journey is a testament to my commitment to excellence,
                    continuous learning, and the belief that well-crafted design has the power to enhance the way we
                    interact with the digital world.</p>
